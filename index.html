                <p>Colour; a thing we interact with on a daily basis and we experience the warm fiery nature of reds and calming effects of blue from the moment we open our eyes. However, what exactly is colour?</p>

                <p>The first known theory of colour we have is actually from Aristotle, where he suggested that all colours came from lightness and darkness, and correlated them the four elements - water, air earth, and fire and these theories held until the publishing of “Opticks, or, A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light. Also two Treatises of the Species and Magnitude of Curvilinear Figures” in 1704 by Newton. Newton passed a light through a prism where he identified the visible light spectrum of ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) which humans can see. The cones within our eyes are sensitive to the wavelengths found on the visible spectrum, allowing us to see what we call colours.</p>
                
                <p>Goethe, however, argued instead that colour was not simply just measurements, but had a subjective element where each person would perceive colour differently. “Zur Farbenlehre [Theory of Color]” which was published in 1810 establishes the foundation that colour is understood by artists today.</p>
                
                <p>LeBlon on the other hand created the outline of the foundation of printing colours and the method of using primary colours (red, yellow, and blue) to create secondary colours along with the concept of additive and subtractive colours. These are found in “Coloritto; of the Harmony of Colouring in Painting: Reduced to Mechanical Practice under Early Precepts and Infallible Rules; Together with some Coloured Figures, In order to render the field Precepts and Rules intelligible, not only to Painters, but even to all Lovers of Painting” from 1722.
                    From this we can see that colour is actually incredibly interdisciplinary by nature and the angles we can look at colour includes a scientific approach via understanding colour space, colour models and their coloration with spectral light, or we can look at it through the lens of a medium with a history cemented in pigments, human perception and the arts. We also are forced into a limited experience of colours with the cones we have. Birds have double cones allowing them to see ultraviolet wavelengths, while humans only have cone cells to perceive red, green and blue (RGB).
                    </p>
                <p>So colour… a way in which we perceive and understand the world through our eyes… What exactly is it?</p>
