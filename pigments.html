            <p>Artists and printmakers today enjoy a wide variety of colour options that are both cheaply and readily available to them which wasn’t always the case. From only having a few colours of the classical world like reds oches, burnt blacks, bone whites to now having Vantas(Vertically Aligned NanoTube Arrays)black that absorb up to 99.96% of visible light, technological changes have both increased our usable colour range along with decrease high cost and toxicity.</p>
            <p>Initially pigments were used on cave walls and included ochres or coloured clays along with soot from burnt animal fats, and were then produced on a larger scale in Egypt and China where cleaning and washing led to brighter purer colours. Minerals like malachite and cinnabar were also grinded down and egyptian blue was also discovered from the sand and copper creating a blue glass that could be grounded. Romans also were producing colours like the expensive tyrian purple which came from the mucus of thousands of snails and greeks made use of white lead.</p>
            <p>During the renaissance, earth pigments from roasted siennas and umbers were created by Italians and were paired with terre verte or green earth. The rich dye cochineal red was also found in the time and was made of insects of the same name. This is also where we see lapis lazuli crushed and used for genuine ultramarine, a pigment truly worth more than gold.</p>
            <p>Many other colours were created by accident like prussian blue, thanks to Jacob Diebach who created the first synthesised colour in 1704, and the discovery of synthetic dyes comes from William Henry Perkins when he was in search of a malaria treatment in 1856. His experiments with coal tar produced the brilliant purple dye mauveine. Jean-Baptiste Guimet made french ultramarine which was drastically cheaper than crushed lapis and had less impurities in 1828.</p>
            <p>With increasing better technology and the ability to isolate new elements meant also that low cost chrome yellow was available as a paint in 1820, while in 1834 zinc oxide became a safer alternative than the previously used lead white. The 1860’s saw a massive boom in the synthetic dye industry with a vast variety of colours showcased in yarn dyed catalogues, including dyes which could be used without profession chemist know-hows.The 19th century saw alizarian, a colourant found in the roots of the madder plant as a star as it was duplicated independently both in germany and in britain. By the end of the 19th century, almost any colour could be purchased for a relatively low price and were then used for industrial paints and eventually acrylic paints that were invented in the 1940’s.</p>
            <p>Eventually the desire to own and patient colours rose, and the most notable example of this is vantasblack, which was developed for satellites. Anish Kapoor seized exclusive rights in 2016 to the material, throwing the art community in a rage. In retaliation Stuart Semple created the “world’s pinkest pink” in which all artists but Kapoor could use it as it was illegal for him to purchase. Kapoor eventually gave way and flouted the ban, but Semple continued to make pigments like the “world’s most glittery glitter” which still Kapoor was also not allowed to use.</p>
