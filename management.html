                    <p>Consistency in colour both digitally and physically are incredibly important. A simple example of this is taking RGB images and converting to CMYK images for printing to reduce costly misprints. RGB and CMYK each can be described as a colour space and there a need to be able to convert from one to another. How is this done?</p>
                    <p>ICC (International Color Consortium) Profiles can be used in colour management to characterise data inputs and outputs on devices and allow for colour mapping, going from one colour space to another. Essentially CIELAB and CIEXYZ are used to convert the input space to the profile connection space and then to the desired output space. This is done with things like Bradford transformations, Hunt-Pointer-Estevez transformations, Stockman & Sharpe  functions, and von Kries Transform Method.</p>
                    <p>Pantone LLC on the other hand is a company that holds a proprietary colour space thatâ€™s used by graphic design, fashion, printing and more in a multitude of materials which allows for ensured consistency as people can refer to and reference the specific pantone colours and reference books across the industries regardless of the equipment used. They also do and sell their research on trending colours for the coming year. However in 2022, Adobe required designers to pay an extra $15/month for the pantone colour coordinates which angered artists who were also buying the physical pantone guides already for hundreds of dollars. Stuart Semple responded by releasing FREETONE which was a freeware clone and barred any employees and associates of Adobe and Pantone from buying, using or downloading Freetone.</p>
